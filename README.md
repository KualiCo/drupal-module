# kualico-cm-drupal-module
This drupal module is meant to simplify the interaction with the CM api in Drupal.

Alone it will display nothing other than its own config page, where the user will enter the details specific to their
CM instance. When enabled and configured, you can use the methods provided in your development of drupal modules that
need data from the CM API (e.g. course catalogs, program details, etc).
